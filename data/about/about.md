Hello, welcome to next-js Paper.

While learning nextjs, I wanted to build a small website from scratch using the concepts I had learnt.

I had seen the hugo-paper theme before and really liked the minimal design of it.

So I decided to port this beautiful theme as a means of getting familiar with nextjs.

I am really thankful to [nanxiaobei](https://github.com/nanxiaobei) for encouraging me to port this theme.

It is pretty basic at the moment and may not have all the features of Hugo Paper as yet, but we will get there gradually.

Feel free to fork it, add in your suggestions and raise issues.
